a benchmark to validate the lottery scheduler implementation.

benchmark should do this:
- Create multiple processes.
- Assign different nice values to the processes.
- Collect information about what processes are being scheduled 
  (using the statistics produced from your lottery scheduler)
- Write the collected information in a file that shows relevant statistics. 
  You can choose the type of statistics that will highlight how processes with higher nice values are scheduled more.
- You should include the results of the benchmark in your design document and benchmark report. 
- Also, you should provide a script that allows the graders to recreate the benchmark.
